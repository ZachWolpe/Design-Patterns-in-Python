**SOLID Design Principles for Object-Oriented Programming.**


The structural design of OOP software can take any form. The SOLID design principles are a set of (best-practice) OOP class structure heuristics to improve your code.

The goal of SOLID design is simple:

_“To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on.”_

The principles, compiled to form the SOLID acronym, are:

  - *S* — Single Responsibility Principle
  - *O* — Open-Closed Principle
  - *L* — Liskov Substitution Principle
  - *I* — Interface Segregation Principle
  - *D* — Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

*A class should only do one thing (separation of concerns) and therefore only has a single reason to change.*
